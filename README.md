> Note: I started working on this project from 1st August, 2024. The initial v1 was ready within 4-5 days. Then I started working on v2. Bot v2 and Webapp are part of v2. This repos is a monorepo created using turbo which contains all code of Bot v2 and Webapp also created seperate package for Prisma and then all the changes will be made in this repo itself.
